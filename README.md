# 🖐️ Virtual Keyboard with Hand Gesture Control

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents an innovative, contactless virtual keyboard that leverages computer vision and hand gesture recognition. By using hand gestures captured via webcam, users can interact with a floating on-screen keyboard, enabling hygienic and futuristic typing—ideal for touchless kiosks, accessibility interfaces, and smart environments.

## 🎯 Core Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✋ **Hand Gesture Control**       | Detects and tracks the position of hands and fingers using a webcam.           |
| 👆 **Pinch-to-Type**             | A pinch gesture (index + thumb) is interpreted as a keypress.                  |
| ✊ **Fist to Exit**               | A fist gesture closes or exits the keyboard application.                       |
| ⌫ **Backspace Functionality**    | Includes a virtual "BACK" key for erasing text.                                |
| 🔄 **Click Sensitivity Control** | Prevents accidental key presses by adjusting sensitivity thresholds.           |
| 💡 **Visual Feedback**           | Keys light up when hovered over or pressed to provide real-time feedback.      |
| 🎨 **Enhanced UI**               | A neatly centered, responsive QWERTY layout that fits most screen sizes.       |
| 📝 **Real-time Typing Output**   | Displays the typed text in real time, which can be captured or used elsewhere. |

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - for camera handling and image processing
* [CVZone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone) - simplifies gesture and face detection using MediaPipe
* [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) - underlying library for hand tracking
* NumPy - for matrix operations
* PyAutoGUI - for simulating actual keypresses on the system

You can find all exact versions and dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

## 🧠 Gesture Controls & User Interaction

| Gesture                      | Action                      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ✋ **Open hand**              | Navigation — move over keys |
| 🤏 **Pinch (index + thumb)** | Select key                  |
| ✊ **Fist**                   | Close keyboard              |
| 🅱️ **"BACK" button**        | Delete previous character   |
| ❌ **"CLOSE" button**         | Exit the application        |

Visual cues (like color changes) indicate when a key is hovered or clicked.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### 🔍 Hand Detection

* Uses CVZone’s `HandTrackingModule`
* Underlying framework: Google MediaPipe
* Detection confidence threshold: `0.8`
* Real-time tracking of up to **2 hands**
* Tracks 21 landmarks per hand, including fingertips, joints, and palm base

### 🧱 Virtual Keyboard Layout

* QWERTY layout (A–Z) with:

  * SPACE
  * BACK
  * CLOSE
* Each key is represented by a rectangle drawn using OpenCV
* Key press is determined by:

  * Distance between index and thumb landmarks
  * Hand position relative to key rectangle
* Enhanced with lighting and visual feedback using color transitions

### ⏱️ Performance Optimizations

* Click debounce logic using a delay timer (`clickDelayCounter`)
* Adjustable gesture detection threshold for responsiveness
* Efficient frame processing (\~20-30 FPS depending on hardware)
* Scaled and centered keyboard layout for any screen size

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Lighting Dependency**: Poor lighting reduces hand detection accuracy
2. **Hardware Variability**: Performance can vary across different webcam models
3. **Gesture Calibration**: Might need threshold tuning for small or large hands
4. **No Sound Feedback**: Currently lacks haptic or audio feedback

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* [ ] **Support for Special Characters** (e.g., ! @ # \$ % ^ & \*)
* [ ] **Predictive Text System** using basic NLP
* [ ] **Custom Keyboard Layouts** with language and size options
* [ ] **Improved Low-Light Detection** using brightness normalization
* [ ] **Multi-language Support** (e.g., Hindi, Spanish, French, etc.)
* [ ] **Voice Dictation Integration** (for hybrid typing modes)
* [ ] **User Calibration Wizard** to adapt sensitivity to individual hands

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging Tips

* Ensure good ambient lighting; avoid direct sunlight or shadows
* Place the camera at an appropriate angle (ideally top-front)
* Use print statements or logging to verify landmark coordinates
* Test with `cv2.imshow()` to debug frames, contours, or gestures
* Use OpenCV’s `waitKey()` for frame-by-frame analysis when debugging

You can add screenshots of:

* Keyboard layout UI
* Hover and click gestures in action
* Real-time typing result window
